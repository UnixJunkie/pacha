PACHA: Pairwise Chemical Aligner
====

Overview

## Description
PACHA is a chemical graph alignment software. Given two chemical compounds represented as small graphs,
PACHA outputs alignments, a.k.a atom-atom mapping, between two compounds. Graph alignements are useful
for building from a compound-compound pair a feature vector that can be used for input of a machine learning,
e.g., support vector machine.
Main applications are reconstructions of metabolic pathway and virtual screening, etc.
